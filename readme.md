## Project Overview

Your project is to build a note taking app. The app should allow users to create, edit and delete notes. The app should also allow users to search for notes by title and content.

### Requirements

- The CLI (Command line interface) should display a menu with the following options:
  - Create a note
  - Edit a note
  - Delete a note
  - Search for a note
  - Exit
- All CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations should be performed within the CLI.
- The app should handle errors using try-catch blocks.
- The app should use classes and constructors.
- The app should use Dart's null safety feature.
- The app should follow proper code structuring and formatting.
- The app should be well documented.

## Submission Guidelines

- The app should be pushed to Github and a pull request should be created. You can check how to push your code to Github in section [2.1.2 Add Changes](#212-add-changes)
- The pull request title should be in the following format: `<your-name> - <project-name>`. You can check how to make a pull request in section [2.1.5. Create a pull request](#215-create-a-pull-request).
- The pull request description should contain the following:
  - A description of the changes made.
  - A screenshot of the app running in the terminal.
